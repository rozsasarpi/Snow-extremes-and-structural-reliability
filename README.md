Snow-extremes-and-structural-reliability
==============

LaTeX source of my dissertation submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Civil Engineering.

__This is an updated version compared to the version available on the [university repository](https://repozitorium.omikk.bme.hu/handle/10890/1551?locale-attribute=en).__ 

The reason: according to the rules of Pál Vásárhelyi Doctoral School of Civil Engineering and Earth Sciences the dissertation submitted for final reviews cannot be updated, thus even the reviewers' comments cannot be incorporated.

__Info on updates:__

* incorporate some suggestions, observations made by the reviewers;
* correct some typos and minor editorial errors;
* no major modifications are made, the results and conclusions are unaffected.
