  Abstract                 = {In the reliability analysis of safety critical complex engineering structures, a very large number of the system parameters can be considered as random variables. The difficulty in computing the failure probability using the classical first- and second-order reliability methods (FORM and SORM) increases rapidly with the number of variables or ‘dimension’. There are mainly two reasons behind this. The first is the increase in computational time with the increase in the number of random variables. In principle, this problem can be handled with superior computational tools. The second reason, which is perhaps more fundamental, is that there are some conceptual difficulties typically associated with high dimensions. This means that even when one manages to carry out the necessary computations, the application of existing FORM and SORM may still lead to incorrect results in high dimensions. This paper is aimed at addressing this issue. Based on the asymptotic distribution of quadratic form in Gaussian random variables, two formulations for the case when the number of random variables n→∞ is provided. The first is called ‘strict asymptotic formulation’ and the second is called ‘weak asymptotic formulation’. Both approximations result in simple closed-form expressions for the probability of failure of an engineering structure. The proposed asymptotic approximations are compared with existing approximations and Monte Carlo simulations using numerical examples.},

  abstract =  {Abstract Piping erosion has been proved to be one of the failure mechanisms that contributes the most to the total probability of failure on the Dutch flood defence systems. The present study aimed to find the impact of correlation and tail dependence between soil parameters present in the Sellmeijer revised limit state equation for piping safety assessment, particularly between the grain size and hydraulic conductivity parameters. A copula based random sampling method was used as a tool to include this effect in the probabilistic estimation of this type of failure. The method was framed in a real case study for a flood defence along the Lek river, in The Netherlands. The results showed that inclusion of correlation between the two parameters reduces the variance of the limit state marginal distribution by almost 10% when compared to the uncorrelated case. This effect changes the tail values sampling frequency and therefore reduces the probability of failure by a factor of 1.7. The omission of correlation between the two parameters for safety assessment based on the Sellmeijer limit state function may result in over dimensioned structures. },

Here, we use an extensive dataset of 1,372 climate researchers and their publication and citation data to show that (i) 97–98% of the climate researchers most actively publishing in the field surveyed here support the tenets of ACC outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and (ii) the relative climate expertise and scientific prominence of the researchers unconvinced of ACC are substantially below that of the convinced researchers.},

A Bayesian predictive information criterion is proposed as an estimator of the posterior mean of the expected loglikelihood of the predictive distribution when the specified family of probability distributions does not contain the true distribution. The proposed criterion is developed by correcting the asymptotic bias of the posterior mean of the loglikelihood as an estimator of its expected loglikelihood. In the evaluation of hierarchical Bayesian models with random effects, regardless of our parametric focus, the proposed criterion considers the bias correction of the posterior mean of the marginal loglikelihood because it requires a consistent parameter estimator. The use of the bootstrap in model evaluation is also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The summer of 2010 was exceptionally warm in eastern Europe and large parts of Russia. We provide evidence that the anomalous 2010 warmth that caused adverse impacts exceeded the amplitude and spatial extent of the previous hottest summer of 2003. “Mega-heatwaves” such as the 2003 and 2010 events likely broke the 500-year-long seasonal temperature records over approximately 50% of Europe. According to regional multi-model experiments, the probability of a summer experiencing mega-heatwaves will increase by a factor of 5 to 10 within the next 40 years. However, the magnitude of the 2010 event was so extreme that despite this increase, the likelihood of an analog over the same region remains fairly low until the second half of the 21st century.},

It does an excellent job of presenting Bayesian statistics as a perfectly reasonable approach to elementary problems in statistics."<br> -STATS: The Magazine for Students of Statistics, American Statistical Association<br> <br> "Bolstad offers clear explanations of every concept and method making the book accessible and valuable to undergraduate and graduate students alike."<br> -Journal of Applied Statistics<br> <br> The use of Bayesian methods in applied statistical analysis has become increasingly popular, yet most introductory statistics texts continue to only present the subject using frequentist methods. Introduction to Bayesian Statistics, Second Edition focuses on Bayesian methods that can be used for inference, and it also addresses how these methods compare favorably with frequentist alternatives. Teaching statistics from the Bayesian perspective allows for direct probability statements about parameters, and this approach is now more relevant than ever due to computer programs that allow practitioners to work on problems that contain many parameters.<br> <br> This book uniquely covers the topics typically found in an introductory statistics book-but from a Bayesian perspective-giving readers an advantage as they enter fields where statistics is used. This Second Edition provides: <ul> <li>Extended coverage of Poisson and Gamma distributions <li>Two new chapters on Bayesian inference for Poisson observations and Bayesian inference for the standard deviation for normal observations <li>A twenty-five percent increase in exercises with selected answers at the end of the book <li>A calculus refresher appendix and a summary on the use of statistical tables <li>New computer exercises that use R functions and Minitab(r) macros for Bayesian analysis and Monte Carlo simulations <li>Introduction to Bayesian Statistics, Second Edition is an invaluable textbook for advanced undergraduate and graduate-level statistics courses as well as a practical reference for statisticians who require a working knowledge of Bayesian statistics. </ul>}},

In this paper we make the less restrictive assumption that such a normal, homoscedastic, linear model is appropriate after some suitable transformation has been applied to the y's. Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

There is a clear philosophy, a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a “savvy” prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used. Various facets of such multimodel inference are presented here, particularly methods of model averaging.}

The parameters of the model are expressed as functions of the seasonal mean sea level pressure anomaly and seasonal squared sea level pressure gradient index. Using projections of the sea level pressure under three different forcing scenarios by the Canadian coupled climate model, projections of the parameters of the nonhomogeneous Poisson process are made, trends in these projections are determined, return-value estimates of significant wave height up to the end of the twenty-first century are projected, and their uncertainties are assessed. The uncertainty of estimates associated with the nonhomogeneous Poisson process estimates is studied and compared with the homologous estimates obtained using a nonstationary generalized extreme value model.

  Abstract                 = {Bayesian statistics can be used in order to determine the characteristic value of an unknown distribution based on a limited number of test samples. In cases where no previous test results are available, most often a Bayesian method based on vague prior information is used. The assumption of a vague or uniform prior results in a conservative approach in cases where only a limited number of test results are available. However, in case of concrete, prior information on concrete strength can be found in literature or country-specific prior information can be determined. Therefore, the use of a combined vague–informative prior is of particular interest, more specifically in the form of scaled inverse-χ2 distributions that can be used for updating the standard deviation of the strength distribution of concrete. The differences between the use of a vague and a combined vague–informative prior are investigated through Monte Carlo simulations. Because prior information is taken into account, the uncertainty regarding the standard deviation of the predictive strength distribution is significantly reduced.},

  Abstract                 = {Quality inspection plays an important role in the production process of concrete, as it inherently stimulates producers for obtaining a higher performance with respect to the investigated properties. In case of the conformity assessment of concrete compressive strength, the concrete strength distribution is filtered due to the rejection or acceptance of certain batches and this filter effect can be quantified using Bayesian updating techniques. As a consequence of the filter effect, conformity control has a positive influence on the structural reliability of concrete structures. This filter effect can be quantified by using an approximation method as developed herein or also by using classical FORM/SORM techniques. In order to illustrate the influence of conformity control on structural reliability, concrete elements (columns and beams) which are designed according to the Eurocodes, are analysed considering basic limit state equations, i.e. for compression and bending. Moreover, the influence of the reinforcement ratio and the load ratio on the filter effect is investigated. Numerical analyses reveal that the filter effect may positively influence especially reliability of lightly reinforced concrete members exposed to compression. It appears that it has a minor effect where reinforcement properties govern failure.},

It is all too easy to blame global trends or some sort of external intervention, but in this article we argue that statistical methods that do not take comprehensive account of the uncertainties involved in both model and predictions, are bound to produce an over-optimistic appraisal of future extremes that is often contradicted by observed hydrological events. Based on the annual and daily rainfall data on the central coast of Venezuela, different modeling strategies and inference approaches show that the 1999 rainfall which caused the worst environmentally related tragedy in Venezuelan history was extreme, but not implausible given the historical evidence. We follow in turn a classical likelihood and Bayesian approach, arguing that the latter is the most natural approach for taking into account all uncertainties. In each case we emphasize the importance of making inference on predicted levels of the process rather than model parameters. Our most detailed model comprises of seasons with unknown starting points and durations for the extremes of daily rainfall whose behavior is described using a standard threshold model. Based on a Bayesian analysis of this model, so that both prediction uncertainty and process heterogeneity are properly modeled, we find that the 1999 event has a sizeable probability which implies that such an occurrence within a reasonably short time horizon could have been anticipated. Finally, since accumulation of extreme rainfall over several days is an additional difficulty—and indeed, the catastrophe of 1999 was exaggerated by heavy rainfall on successive days—we examine the effect of timescale on our broad conclusions, finding results to be broadly similar across different choices.},

Under conditions of uncertainty, safety and serviceability of structures can be assured only in terms of the probability of survival (or conversely of failure); accordingly, the level of safety is expressed explicitly as a function of the degree of uncertainty. The assumptions necessary to implement probability concepts in the development of practical design criteria and code provisions are explained and delineated. Uncertainty (including uncertainty associated with errors in estimation and imperfection in mathematical models) is expressed in terms of the coefficient of variation; in this term, its effect on safety and design can be assessed systematically and logically through first-order statistical analysis. Specific proposals for evaluating safety level and for developing safety and load factors for design are developed.},

  Abstract                 = {The existing attitude that the criterion for choice of plotting position is arbitrary is rebuked and it is shown that a worthwhile criterion can be based on desired statistical properties of the plot, rather than on comparison of plotting positions with estimates of probability for individual sample values. These properties are that any quantile estimate made from the plot should be unbiased and should have smallest mean square error among all such estimates. This leads to specification of plotting position initially in terms of reduced variate rather than probability value. The unbiased plotting position is E(y(i)), the mean of the ith order statistic in samples from the reduced variate population, which differs from one distribution to another. A good approximation for each distribution is available in the probability domain. These take the general form (i − α)(N + 1 − 2α) with α = 38 in the normal case and α = 0.44 in the extreme-value type-1 (EV1) and exponential cases. The Weibull formula, α = 0, is correct for the uniform distribution alone and is shown to be biased for other distributions. Hazen's formula α = 12 shows up much better in terms of bias than many would expect. If a single simple distribution free formula were required then α = 25 would be the best compromise. The plotting position postulates which have supported the Weibull formula for many years are examined and some are seen to be unreasonable in view of statistical facts.},

  Abstract                 = {Climatic warming of about 0.5 ° C in the global mean since the 1970s has strongly increased the occurrence-probability of heat extremes on monthly to seasonal time scales. For the 21st century, climate models predict more substantial warming. Here we show that the multi-model mean of the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) climate models accurately reproduces the evolution over time and spatial patterns of the historically observed increase in monthly heat extremes. For the near-term (i.e., by 2040), the models predict a robust, several-fold increase in the frequency of such heat extremes, irrespective of the emission scenario. However, mitigation can strongly reduce the number of heat extremes by the second half of the 21st century. Unmitigated climate change causes most (>50%) continental regions to move to a new climatic regime with the coldest summer months by the end of the century substantially hotter than the hottest experienced today. We show that the land fraction experiencing extreme heat as a function of global mean temperature follows a simple cumulative distribution function, which depends only on natural variability and the level of spatial heterogeneity in the warming.},

  Abstract                 = {The classical Maximum Entropy (ME) problem consists of determining a probability distribution function (pdf) from a finite set of expectations of known functions. The solution depends on $N+1$ Lagrange multipliers which are determined by solving the set of nonlinear equations formed by the $N$ data constraints and the normalization constraint. In this short communication we give three Matlab programs to calculate these Lagrange multipliers. The first considers the general case where the functions can be any functions. The second considers the special case of power functions $x^n$. In this case the data are the geometrical moments of $p(x)$. The third considers the special case of Fourier series functions $\exp(-j n \omega x)$. In this case the data are the trigonometrical moments of $p(x)$. Some examples are also given to illustrate the usefullness of these programs.},

  Abstract                 = {Structural components and systems have an important safety function in nuclear power plants. Although they are essentially passive under normal operating conditions, they play a key role in mitigating the impact of extreme environmental events such as earthquakes, winds, fire and floods on plant safety. Moreover, the importance of structural components and systems in accident mitigation is amplified by common-cause effects. Reinforced concrete structural components and systems in NPPs are subject to a phenomenon known as aging, leading to time-dependent changes in strength and stiffness that may impact their ability to withstand various challenges during their service lives from operation, the environment and accidents. Time-dependent changes in structural properties as well as challenges to the system are random in nature. Accordingly, condition assessment of existing structures should be performed within a probabilistic framework. The mathematical formalism of a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) provides a means for identifying aging structural components that may play a significant role in mitigating plant risk. Structural condition assessments supporting a decision regarding continued service can be rendered more efficient if guided by the logic of a PRA.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a substantial literature on estimation for the three-parameter lognormal distribution {ln(Y - γ) ∼ N(μ,σ2)}. A large variety of estimators has been developed. The emphasis placed on alternative techniques by some of these authors is substantially due to the fact that the method of maximum likelihood has wrongly been discredited because of supposed computational difficulties and theoretical uncertainties. The literature has concentrated on point estimation with scant attention being paid to interval estimates. It is the purpose of this note to show how the interval estimation problem may be examined via the likelihood function. A comparison of these likelihood intervals, approximate and exact confidence intervals is made. Graphical examination of the likelihood function also presents a simple way of overcoming computational difficulties in obtaining point estimates (and shows why they arise), enabling a thorough examination of the information contained in the data about the model parameters and suggesting stable parameter transformations.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a method for fatigue damage propagation model selection, updating, and averaging using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. Uncertainties from model choice, model parameter, and measurement are explicitly included using probabilistic modeling. Response measurement data are used to perform Bayesian updating to reduce the uncertainty of fatigue damage prognostics. All the variables of interest, including the Bayes factors for model selection, the posterior distributions of model parameters, and the averaged results of system responses are obtained by one reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. The overall procedure is demonstrated by a numerical example and a practical fatigue problem involving two fatigue crack growth models. Experimental data are used to validate the performance of the method.},

  Abstract                 = {The Gumbel model is often used to fit annual maximum wind speed or wind velocity pressure. The commonly used fitting methods include the method of moments, the method of maximum likelihood, the method of L-moments, and the Lieblein BLUE (i.e., generalized least-squares method (GLSM)). Previously, the coefficients of the estimators for the latter method have not been available for large sample size, and the relative performance of the GLSM to other fitting methods such as the method of L-moments is unknown. In this study, we evaluate these coefficients for a sample size up to 100, and identify trends in the calculated coefficients. The relative performance of commonly used fitting methods for the Gumbel distribution, including the GLSM, is evaluated in terms of efficiency, bias, and root-mean square error. We illustrate their application and impact on the estimated return period values of the annual maximum wind speed for 14 locations in Canada.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Changes in the extreme annual wind speed in and around the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Canada) were investigated through a nonstationary extreme value analysis of the annual maximum 10-m wind speed obtained from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) dataset as well as observed data from selected stations of Environment Canada. A generalized extreme value distribution with time-dependent location and scale parameters was used to estimate quantiles of interest as functions of time at locations where significant trend was detected. A Bayesian method, the generalized maximum likelihood approach, is implemented to estimate the parameters. The analysis yielded shape parameters very close to 0, suggesting that the distribution can be modeled using the Gumbel distribution. A similar analysis using a nonstationary Gumbel model yielded similar quantiles with narrower credibility intervals. Overall, little change was detected over the period 1979?2004. Only 7% of the investigated grids exhibited trends at the 5% significant level, and the analysis performed on the reanalysis data at locations of significant trend indicated a rise in the median extreme annual wind speed by up to 2 m s?1 per decade in the southern coastal areas with a corresponding increase in the 90% and 99% quantiles of the extreme annual wind speeds by up to 5 m s?1 per decade. Also in the northern part of the gulf and some offshore areas in the south, the 50%, 90%, and 99% quantile values of the extreme annual wind speeds are noted to drop by up to 1.5, 3, and 5 m s?1, respectively. While the directions of the changes in the annual extremes at the selected stations are similar to those of the reanalysis data at nearby grid cells, the magnitudes and significance levels of the changes are generally inconsistent. Change at the same significance level over the same period of the NARR dataset was noted only at 2 stations out of 13.

  Abstract                 = {This study presents roadmaps for each of the 50 United States to convert their all-purpose energy systems (for electricity, transportation, heating/cooling, and industry) to ones powered entirely by wind, water, and sunlight (WWS). The plans contemplate 80-85% of existing energy replaced by 2030 and 100% replaced by 2050. Conversion would reduce each state's end-use power demand by a mean of [similar]39.3% with [similar]82.4% of this due to the efficiency of electrification and the rest due to end-use energy efficiency improvements. Year 2050 end-use U.S. all-purpose load would be met with [similar]30.9% onshore wind, [similar]19.1% offshore wind, [similar]30.7% utility-scale photovoltaics (PV), [similar]7.2% rooftop PV, [similar]7.3% concentrated solar power (CSP) with storage, [similar]1.25% geothermal power, [similar]0.37% wave power, [similar]0.14% tidal power, and [similar]3.01% hydroelectric power. Based on a parallel grid integration study, an additional 4.4% and 7.2% of power beyond that needed for annual loads would be supplied by CSP with storage and solar thermal for heat, respectively, for peaking and grid stability. Over all 50 states, converting would provide [similar]3.9 million 40-year construction jobs and [similar]2.0 million 40-year operation jobs for the energy facilities alone, the sum of which would outweigh the [similar]3.9 million jobs lost in the conventional energy sector. Converting would also eliminate [similar]62 000 (19 000-115 000) U.S. air pollution premature mortalities per year today and [similar]46 000 (12 000-104 000) in 2050, avoiding [similar]$600 ($85-$2400) bil. per year (2013 dollars) in 2050, equivalent to [similar]3.6 (0.5-14.3) percent of the 2014 U.S. gross domestic product. Converting would further eliminate [similar]$3.3 (1.9-7.1) tril. per year in 2050 global warming costs to the world due to U.S. emissions. These plans will result in each person in the U.S. in 2050 saving [similar]$260 (190-320) per year in energy costs ($2013 dollars) and U.S. health and global climate costs per person decreasing by [similar]$1500 (210-6000) per year and [similar]$8300 (4700-17 600) per year, respectively. The new footprint over land required will be [similar]0.42% of U.S. land. The spacing area between wind turbines, which can be used for multiple purposes, will be [similar]1.6% of U.S. land. Thus, 100% conversions are technically and economically feasible with little downside. These roadmaps may therefore reduce social and political barriers to implementing clean-energy policies.},

In particular, the focus is on recorded wind speed data at some chosen measurement stations along the Norwegian coast. The method, briefly referred to as the ACER method, is presented in some detail. It is pointed out that the ACER method, if properly implemented, will provide a statistical representation with error bounds of the exact extreme value distribution given by the data. It is also applicable to nonstationary time series. The estimated return level values obtained by the ACER method are compared to the corresponding values obtained by the annual maxima method and the peaks-over-threshold method. Based on the overall performance, it is concluded that the ACER method may indeed be the preferred choice over the other two methods tested.},

  Abstract                 = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews the historical development of the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) methods and applications in the nuclear industry. A review of nuclear safety and regulatory developments in the early days of nuclear power in the United States has been presented. It is argued that due to technical difficulties for measuring and characterizing uncertainties and concerns over legal challenges, safety design and regulation of nuclear power plants has primarily relied upon conservative safety assessment methods derived based on a set of design and safety principles. Further, it is noted that the conservatism adopted in safety and design assessments has allowed the use of deterministic performance assessment methods. This approach worked successfully in the early years of nuclear power epoch as the reactor design proved to be safe enough. However, it has been observed that as the conservative approach to design and safety criteria proved arbitrary, and yielded inconsistencies in the degree to which different safety measures in nuclear power plants protect safety and public heath, the urge for a more consistent assessment of safety became apparent in the late 1960s. In the early 1970s, as a result of public and political pressures, then the US Atomic Energy Commission initiated a new look at the safety of the nuclear power plants through a comprehensive study called ‘Reactor Safety Study’ (WASH-1400, or ‘Rasmussen Study’—after its charismatic study leader Professor Norman Rasmussen of MIT) to demonstrate safety of the nuclear power plants. Completed in October 1975, this landmark study introduced a novel probabilistic, systematic and holistic approach to the assessment of safety, which ultimately resulted in a sweeping paradigm shift in safety design and regulation of nuclear power in the United States in the turn of the Century. Technical issues of historic significance and concerns raised by the subsequent reviews of the Rasmussen Study have been discussed. Effect of major events and developments such as the Three Mile Island accident and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Nuclear Industry sponsored studies on the tools, techniques and applications of the PRA that culminated in the present day risk-informed initiatives has been discussed.},

The measure of reliability that incorporates these parameter uncertainties is termed the predictive reliability index. Methods for computing this measure and the corresponding failure probability are introduced. A simple approximate formula is derived for the predictive reliability index, which requires a single solution of the reliability problem together with parameter sensitivities with respect to mean parameter values. The approach also provides measures of the uncertainties inherent in the estimates of the reliability index and the failure probability, which arise from parameter uncertainties. An illustrative example involving component and system problems demonstrates the influence of parameter uncertainties on the predictive reliability index and the accuracy of the simple approximation formula.},

  Abstract                 = {The sources and characters of uncertainties in engineering modeling for risk and reliability analyses are discussed. While many sources of uncertainty may exist, they are generally categorized as either aleatory or epistemic. Uncertainties are characterized as epistemic, if the modeler sees a possibility to reduce them by gathering more data or by refining models. Uncertainties are categorized as aleatory if the modeler does not foresee the possibility of reducing them. From a pragmatic standpoint, it is useful to thus categorize the uncertainties within a model, since it then becomes clear as to which uncertainties have the potential of being reduced. More importantly, epistemic uncertainties may introduce dependence among random events, which may not be properly noted if the character of uncertainties is not correctly modeled. Influences of the two types of uncertainties in reliability assessment, codified design, performance-based engineering and risk-based decision-making are discussed. Two simple examples demonstrate the influence of statistical dependence arising from epistemic uncertainties on systems and time-variant reliability problems.},

Maximum-likelihood estimation of the parameters of the two distributions is considered. Large-sample formulae are given for the covariance matrix of the estimated parameters, and implementation of a small-sample method (the jackknife) is also described. Other topics dealt with are tests for goodness of fit of the posited distribution, and tests whether special cases (no measurement errors or an infinite upper limit to the power-law distribution) may be preferred. The application of the methodology is illustrated by fitting convolved distributions to masses of giant molecular clouds in M33 and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and to H i cloud masses in the LMC.},

  Abstract                 = {The present paper advocates a probabilistic framework for assessing structural vulnerability against earthquakes. This is justified by the significant randomness that characterizes not only the earthquake excitation (amplitude, frequency content, duration), but also the structural system itself (i.e. stochastic variations in the material properties). Performance predictions can readily be summarized in the form of fragility curves which express the probability of exceeding various damage levels (from minor to collapse) with respect to a metric of the earthquake intensity. In this paper, a Bayesian framework is proposed for the derivation of fragility curves which can produce estimates irrespective of the amount of data available. It is particularly flexible when combined with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques and can efficiently provide credible intervals for the estimates. Furthermore, a general procedure based on logistic regression is illustrated that can lead in a principled manner to the derivation of fragility surfaces which express the probability of exceeding a damage level with respect to several measures of the earthquake load and can thus produce more accurate predictions. The methodologies presented are illustrated using data generated from computational simulations for a structure on top of a saturated sand deposit which is susceptible to liquefaction.},

  Abstract                 = {This study aims at investigating the influence of the Young modulus variability on the mechanical behaviour of a nuclear containment vessel in case of a loss of cooling agent accident and under the assumption of an elastic behaviour. To achieve this investigation, the Monte-Carlo Method is carried out thanks to a middleware which encapsulates the different components (random field generation, FE simulations) and enables calculations parallelisation. The main goal is to quantify the uncertainty propagation by comparing the maximal values of outputs of interest (orthoradial stress and Mazars equivalent strain) for each realisation of the considered random field with the ones obtained from a reference calculation taking into account uniform field (equal to the expected value of the random field). The Young modulus is supposed to be accurately represented by a weakly homogeneous random field and realisations are provided through its truncated Karhunen–Loève expansion. This study reveals that the expected value for the maximal equivalent strain in the structure is more important when considering the Young modulus spatial variability than the value obtained from a deterministic approach with a uniform Young modulus field. The influence of the correlation length is investigated too. Finally it is shown that there is no correlation between the maximal values location of equivalent strain and the ones where the Young modulus extreme values are observed for each realisation.},

Dear Senator: 
 
As you consider climate change legislation, we, as leaders of scientific 
organizations, write to state the consensus scientific view. 
 
Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is 
occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the 
greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver. 
These conclusions are based on multiple independent lines of evidence, 
and contrary assertions are inconsistent with an objective assessment of 
the vast body of peer-reviewed science. Moreover, there is strong 
evidence that ongoing climate change will have broad impacts on 
society, including the global economy and on the environment. For the 
United States, climate change impacts include sea level rise for coastal 
states, greater threats of extreme weather events, and increased risk of 
regional water scarcity, urban heat waves, western wildfires, and the 
disturbance of biological systems throughout the country. The severity 
of climate change impacts is expected to increase substantially in the 
coming decades.
1
 
If we are to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change, emissions 
of greenhouse gases must be dramatically reduced. In addition, 
adaptation will be necessary to address those impacts that are already 
unavoidable. Adaptation efforts include improved infrastructure design, 
more sustainable management of water and other natural resources, 
modified agricultural practices, and improved emergency responses to 
storms, floods, fires and heat waves. 
 
We in the scientific community offer our assistance to inform your 
deliberations as you seek to address the impacts of climate change.

 The conclusions in this paragraph reflect the scientific consensus represented by, for example, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and U.S. Global Change Research Program. Many scientific societies have endorsed these findings in their own statements, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Chemical Society, American Geophysical Union, American Meteorological Society, and American Statistical Association. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper aims to propose a bootstrap method for characterizing the effect of uncertainty in shear strength parameters on slope reliability. The procedure for a traditional slope reliability analysis with fixed distributions of shear strength parameters is presented first. Then, the variations of the mean and standard deviation of shear strength parameters and the Akaike Information Criterion values associated with various distributions are studied to characterize the uncertainties in distribution parameters and types of shear strength parameters. The reliability of an infinite slope is presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. The results indicate that the bootstrap method can effectively model the uncertain probability distributions of shear strength parameters. The uncertain distributions of shear strength parameters have a significant influence on slope reliability. With the bootstrap method, the slope reliability index is represented by a confidence interval instead of a single fixed index. The confidence interval increases with increasing factor of slope safety. Considering both the uncertainties in distribution parameters and distribution types of shear strength parameters leads to a higher variation and a wider confidence interval of reliability index.},

  Abstract                 = {Statistical thinking in wildlife biology and ecology has been profoundly influenced by the introduction of AIC (Akaike's information criterion) as a tool for model selection and as a basis for model averaging. In this paper, we advocate the Bayesian paradigm as a broader framework for multimodel inference, one in which model averaging and model selection are naturally linked, and in which the performance of AIC-based tools is naturally evaluated. Prior model weights implicitly associated with the use of AIC are seen to highly favor complex models: in some cases, all but the most highly parameterized models in the model set are virtually ignored a priori. We suggest the usefulness of the weighted BIC (Bayesian information criterion) as a computationally simple alternative to AIC, based on explicit selection of prior model probabilities rather than acceptance of default priors associated with AIC. We note, however, that both procedures are only approximate to the use of exact Bayes factors. We discuss and illustrate technical difficulties associated with Bayes factors, and suggest approaches to avoiding these difficulties in the context of model selection for a logistic regression. Our example highlights the predisposition of AIC weighting to favor complex models and suggests a need for caution in using the BIC for computing approximate posterior model weights.},

  Abstract                 = {The consideration of uncertainties plays an increasing role in the design of geotechnical structures. An important procedure in the uncertainty analysis is the reliability assessment whereby the required statistical quantities and distributions are assumed to be known exactly. Due to small sample observations and missing information this is not the case in practical applications and uncertainties in the stochastic parameters themselves have to be considered. In our study we estimate the parameter variation of soil properties by statistical procedures and perform an extended reliability analysis of a shallow foundation considering these uncertainties. We propose a novel approach based on a Taylor series expansion which enables the estimation of the failure probability variation very efficiently.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a discussion on assessing the potential impacts of climate change on the atmospheric corrosion rates of exposed steel structures. The effects on atmospheric corrosion due to changes in the environmental temperature, carbon dioxide, relative humidity, wind, rainfall and pollution are considered. The limitations and complexities of these assessments are discussed. To demonstrate the use and limitations of this science to evaluate effects related to climate change, a model developed in Australia to predict corrosion is combined with climate change models to project the change in the corrosion rates of steel components and protective zinc coatings in constructions. The method is applied to constructions located along the coastal areas of two Australian cities: Melbourne and Brisbane. These assessments are made using the A1FI scenario, the highest emission scenario defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, applied to nine general circulation models. The projected changes in corrosion rates were found to be an increase of ?14% for both zinc and steel in Brisbane and a decrease of ?14% for steel and 9% for zinc in Melbourne. It was also found that the uncertainties associated with the climate change models were small compared to those involved in modelling corrosion for engineering purposes.},

The Gumbel Type I probability distribution is applied to predict extreme values of climatic actions. The authors extend this approach to the generalised Gumbel distribution allowing including an upper limit of the climatic variable. For estimating the distribution parameters, a statistical methodology called ProGumbel has been developed. The implications for statistical analyses of wind speeds and determination of design wind speeds are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {Globally, economic losses from flooding exceeded $19 billion in 2012, and are rising rapidly. Hence, there is an increasing need for global-scale flood risk assessments, also within the context of integrated global assessments. We have developed and validated a model cascade for producing global flood risk maps, based on numerous flood return-periods. Validation results indicate that the model simulates interannual fluctuations in flood impacts well. The cascade involves: hydrological and hydraulic modelling; extreme value statistics; inundation modelling; flood impact modelling; and estimating annual expected impacts. The initial results estimate global impacts for several indicators, for example annual expected exposed population (169 million); and annual expected exposed GDP ($1383 billion). These results are relatively insensitive to the extreme value distribution employed to estimate low frequency flood volumes. However, they are extremely sensitive to the assumed flood protection standard; developing a database of such standards should be a research priority. Also, results are sensitive to the use of two different climate forcing datasets. The impact model can easily accommodate new, user-defined, impact indicators. We envisage several applications, for example: identifying risk hotspots; calculating macro-scale risk for the insurance industry and large companies; and assessing potential benefits (and costs) of adaptation measures.},

  Abstract                 = {In engineering applications, probabilistic reliability theory appears to be presently the most important method, however, in many cases precise probabilistic reliability theory cannot be considered as adequate and credible model of the real state of actual affairs. In this paper, we developed a hybrid of probabilistic and non-probabilistic reliability theory, which describes the structural uncertain parameters as interval variables when statistical data are found insufficient. By using the interval analysis, a new method for calculating the interval of the structural reliability as well as the reliability index is introduced in this paper, and the traditional probabilistic theory is incorporated with the interval analysis. Moreover, the new method preserves the useful part of the traditional probabilistic reliability theory, but removes the restriction of its strict requirement on data acquisition. Example is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed theory.},

  Abstract                 = {The probabilistic reliability approach is the most widely used method for reliability analysis. The recent research shows that the reliabilities of structural systems strongly depend on the parameters of the probability model. It is possible that the little error in the estimation of the parameters may lead to the remarkable error of the resulting probability. In this study, we introduce the interval approach into the conventional reliability theory. We present a novel approach which allows us to obtain the system failure probability interval from the statistical parameter intervals of the basic variables. This approach is a combination of the two techniques, namely the classical reliability theory and the interval analysis. In the end of this paper, we show the feasibility of the proposed approach through two examples of the truss systems. },

  abstract = {During the last decades, copulas have been increasingly used to model the dependence across several
random variables such as the joint modelling of the intensity and the duration of rainfall storms. When the problem
consists in modelling extreme values, i.e., only the tails of the distribution, the extreme value theory tells us that one
should consider max-stable distributions and put some restrictions on the copulas to be used. Although the theory
for multivariate extremes is well established, its foundation is usually introduced outside the copula framework. This
paper tries to unify these two frameworks in a single view. Moreover the latest developments on spatial extremes and
max-stable processes will be introduced. At first glance the use of copulas for spatial problems sounds a bit odd but
since usually stochastic processes are observed at a finite number of locations, the inferential procedure is intrinsically
multivariate. An application on the spatial modelling of extreme temperatures in Switzerland is given. Results show
that the use of non extreme value based models can largely underestimate the spatial dependence and the assumptions
made on the spatial dependence structure should be chosen with care}

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a likelihood-based methodology for a probabilistic representation of a stochastic quantity for which only sparse point data and/or interval data may be available. The likelihood function is evaluated from the probability density function (PDF) for sparse point data and the cumulative distribution function for interval data. The full likelihood function is used in this paper to calculate the entire PDF of the distribution parameters. The uncertainty in the distribution parameters is integrated to calculate a single PDF for the quantity of interest. The approach is then extended to non-parametric PDFs, wherein the entire distribution can be discretized at a finite number of points and the probability density values at these points can be inferred using the principle of maximum likelihood, thus avoiding the assumption of any particular distribution. The proposed approach is demonstrated with challenge problems from the Sandia Epistemic Uncertainty Workshop and the results are compared with those of previous studies that pursued different approaches to represent and propagate interval description of input uncertainty.},

  Abstract                 = {The increasing effort to develop and apply nonstationary models in hydrologic frequency analyses under changing environmental conditions can be frustrated when the additional uncertainty related to the model complexity is accounted for along with the sampling uncertainty. In order to show the practical implications and possible problems of using nonstationary models and provide critical guidelines, in this study we review the main tools developed in this field (such as nonstationary distribution functions, return periods, and risk of failure) highlighting advantages and disadvantages. The discussion is supported by three case studies that revise three illustrative examples reported in the scientific and technical literature referring to the Little Sugar Creek (at Charlotte, North Carolina), Red River of the North (North Dakota/Minnesota), and the Assunpink Creek (at Trenton, New Jersey). The uncertainty of the results is assessed by complementing point estimates with confidence intervals (CIs) and emphasizing critical aspects such as the subjectivity affecting the choice of the models’ structure. Our results show that (1) nonstationary frequency analyses should not only be based on at-site time series but require additional information and detailed exploratory data analyses (EDA); (2) as nonstationary models imply that the time-varying model structure holds true for the entire future design life period, an appropriate modeling strategy requires that EDA identifies a well-defined deterministic mechanism leading the examined process; (3) when the model structure cannot be inferred in a deductive manner and nonstationary models are fitted by inductive inference, model structure introduces an additional source of uncertainty so that the resulting nonstationary models can provide no practical enhancement of the credibility and accuracy of the predicted extreme quantiles, whereas possible model misspecification can easily lead to physically inconsistent results; (4) when the model structure is uncertain, stationary models and a suitable assessment of the uncertainty accounting for possible temporal persistence should be retained as more theoretically coherent and reliable options for practical applications in real-world design and management problems; (5) a clear understanding of the actual probabilistic meaning of stationary and nonstationary return periods and risk of failure is required for a correct risk assessment and communication.},

  Abstract                 = {Statistical modeling is a powerful tool for developing and testing theories by way of causal explanation, prediction, and description. In many disciplines there is near-exclusive use of statistical modeling for causal explanation and the assumption that models with high explanatory power are inherently of high predictive power. Conflation between explanation and prediction is common, yet the distinction must be understood for progressing scientific knowledge. While this distinction has been recognized in the philosophy of science, the statistical literature lacks a thorough discussion of the many differences that arise in the process of modeling for an explanatory versus a predictive goal. The purpose of this article is to clarify the distinction between explanatory and predictive modeling, to discuss its sources, and to reveal the practical implications of the distinction to each step in the modeling process.},

Assuming that the data is driven by Pareto or exponential distribution, respectively, the exact likelihood ratio tests for homogeneity to validate the results of regression fits are applied. Further, the statistical dependence between the exceedances and the corresponding altitudes is studied.},

  Abstract                 = {Atmospheric CO2 is a major cause of reinforcement corrosion in bridges, buildings, wharves, and other concrete infrastructure in Australia, United States, United Kingdom and most other countries. The increase in CO2 levels associated with global warming will increase the likelihood of carbonation-induced corrosion. Moreover, temperature rises will increase corrosion rates. Clearly, the impact of climate change on existing and new infrastructure is considerable, as corrosion damage is disruptive to society and costly to repair. The paper describes a probabilistic and reliability-based approach that predicts the probability of corrosion initiation and damage (severe cracking) for concrete infrastructure subjected to carbonation and chloride-induced corrosion resulting from elevated CO2 levels and temperatures. The atmospheric CO2 concentration and local temperature and relative humidity changes with time over the next 100 years in the Australian cities of Sydney and Darwin are projected based on nine General Circulation Models (GCMs) under (i) high CO2 emission scenario, (ii) medium CO2 emission scenario, and (iii) CO2 emission reduction scenario based on policy intervention. The probabilistic analysis included the uncertainty of CO2 concentration, deterioration processes, material properties, dimensions, and predictive models. It was found that carbonation-induced damage risks can increase by over 400% over a time period to 2100 for some regions in Australia. Damage risks for chloride-induced corrosion increase by no more than 15% over the same time period due to temperature increase, but without consideration of ocean acidity change in marine exposure. Corrosion loss of reinforcement is not significant. The results were most sensitive to increases in atmospheric CO2.},

The premises or attributes, which we must take into consideration, are random variables, therefore we often have to deal with a high dimensional multivariate random vector. AÂ multivariate random vector can be represented graphically as a Markov network. Usually the structure of the Markov network is unknown. In this paper we construct special type of junction trees, in order to obtain good approximations of the real probability distribution. These junction trees are capable of revealing some of the conditional independences of the network. We have already introduced the concept of the t-cherry junction tree (E. Kov{\'a}cs and T. Sz{\'a}ntai in Proceedings of the IFIP/IIASA//GAMM Workshop on Coping with Uncertainty, 2010), based on the t-cherry tree graph structure. This approximation uses only two and three dimensional marginal probability distributions. Now we use k-th order t-cherry trees, also called simplex multitrees to introduce the concept of the k-th order t-cherry junction tree. We prove that the k-th order t-cherry junction tree gives the best approximation among the family of k-width junction trees. Then we give a method which starting from a k-th order t-cherry junction tree constructs a (k+1)-th order t-cherry junction tree which gives at least as good approximation. In the last part we present some numerical results and some possible applications.},

The appropriate climatological series for this is the winter season maximum accumulated water equivalent series. Among many distributions investigated, the lognormal distribution provided the best fit to these climatological series. Distributions fitted to 140 stations provided data for preparing contour maps of the parameter estimates. In southern areas of the United States, where snow does not occur every year, the climatological series is a mixture of zeros and water equivalent, maxima. This requires the fitting of mixed distributions in these areas. A contour map is provided of the mixture parameter estimate. Methods for determining confidence intervals for quantiles from both distributions are developed.

  Abstract                 = {Load combinations involving wind and snow load (effects) govern in the design of some types of structures located in heavy snow regions, such as long-span bridges or roof systems in cases where snow drifts could become significant. While load standards such as ASCE 7 provide guidance on combining design loads for design for life safety, guidance is not yet available for other performance levels (limit states). This is expected to become more significant as performance based-design procedures continue to evolve and gain acceptance in the design community. This paper presents an approach to statistically characterize the joint wind–snow hazard for use in performance-based design. Wind loads and snow loads are modeled as renewal pulse processes and combined within a numerical simulation. The results are then used to construct the joint wind–snow hazard level contours corresponding to different annual exceedance probabilities. The procedure described herein, along with the results for the specific cases considered, provide a useful context for relating design loads associated with specific hazard levels to those established for use in life safety design, such as those found in ASCE 7. This enables a discussion on the relationship between strength-based and hazard-specific design values, and between limit state design and performance-based design load combinations.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In the analysis of structural reliability, often a sequence of design points associated with a set of thresholds are sought in order to determine the tail distribution of a response quantity. In this paper, after a brief review of methods for determining the design point, an inverse reliability method named the Î»-method is introduced for efficiently determining the sequence of design points. The Î»-method uses Broydenâ€™s â€śgoodâ€ť method to solve a set of nonlinear simultaneous equations to find the design points for the values of an implicitly defined threshold that is associated with parameter Î». In a special parameter setting, the Î» parameter equals the reliability index, thus allowing convenient implementation of the method. Three numerical examples illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. },

  Abstract                 = {The papers in this volume discuss projections of climate change impacts upon humans and ecosystems under a global mean temperature rise of 4°C above preindustrial levels. Like most studies, they are mainly single-sector or single-region-based assessments. Even the multi-sector or multi-region approaches generally consider impacts in sectors and regions independently, ignoring interactions. Extreme weather and adaptation processes are often poorly represented and losses of ecosystem services induced by climate change or human adaptation are generally omitted. This paper addresses this gap by reviewing some potential interactions in a 4°C world, and also makes a comparison with a 2°C world. In a 4°C world, major shifts in agricultural land use and increased drought are projected, and an increased human population might increasingly be concentrated in areas remaining wet enough for economic prosperity. Ecosystem services that enable prosperity would be declining, with carbon cycle feedbacks and fire causing forest losses. There is an urgent need for integrated assessments considering the synergy of impacts and limits to adaptation in multiple sectors and regions in a 4°C world. By contrast, a 2°C world is projected to experience about one-half of the climate change impacts, with concomitantly smaller challenges for adaptation. Ecosystem services, including the carbon sink provided by the Earth’s forests, would be expected to be largely preserved, with much less potential for interaction processes to increase challenges to adaptation. However, demands for land and water for biofuel cropping could reduce the availability of these resources for agricultural and natural systems. Hence, a whole system approach to mitigation and adaptation, considering interactions, potential human and species migration, allocation of land and water resources and ecosystem services, will be important in either a 2°C or a 4°C world.},

  Abstract                 = {Engineers traditionally base their designs on past experience; this is particularly true in the building and construction industry. In recent decades, however, as the design is increasingly required for systems in environments where there is very little experience to rely on, e.g. nuclear structures, offshore platforms, and space stations, the uncertainty that the engineer faces becomes an important issue and requires serious study. As the uncertainty in the structural loading in general plays a dominant role, in the last decade there has been a rapid increase in the study of the modeling and risk evaluation of loadings on structural systems, in particular, the problem of risk under multiple loads over the structure's lifetime. Methodologies based on probability and statistics theories have been developed to quantify the uncertainty and, as a result, engineers are now better equipped to face the challenge of design under uncertainty. This book provides an account of the development thus far in this area and can be understood by readers with only a basic background in probability and statistics.},

  Abstract                 = {Nature–inspired metaheuristic algorithms, especially those based on swarm intelligence, have attracted much attention in the last ten years. Firefly algorithm appeared in about five years ago, its literature has expanded dramatically with diverse applications. In this paper, we will briefly review the fundamentals of firefly algorithm together with a selection of recent publications. Then, we discuss the optimality associated with balancing exploration and exploitation, which is essential for all metaheuristic algorithms. By comparing with intermittent search strategy, we conclude that metaheuristics such as firefly algorithm are better than the optimal intermittent search strategy. We also analyse algorithms and their implications for higher–dimensional optimisation problems.},

  Abstract                 = {High-order reliability bounds for series systems are mathematically derived, which, based on all the single mode failure probabilities and all the two-mode, three-mode and higher-mode joint failure probabilities, can greatly improve the accuracy of reliability calculation. In the case of normal distribution for all failure modes, the three-order reliability bounds are applied to computing structural system reliability. The results show that the bounds formulae are of high accuracy and practical use.},
